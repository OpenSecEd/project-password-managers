Projects about password managers
================================================================================

This repository contains projects on a variety of topics concerning password 
managers.

The optimal password strategy is to have a long, random password that is unique 
to every service. The purpose of the password manager is to come closer to that 
situation. And there is a [plethora of password managers 
available][list-pwd-managers].

There are two main problems that must be considered for password managers:

- usability, we need usability for people to be able to use them, otherwise 
  there will be no improvement over reusing the same password everywhere.

- security, we need security to prevent any unauthorized access to all the 
  passwords.
